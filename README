Repository of the xaos website code.

How to contribute to this Xaos code:

*Trivial way: Make comments on different parts of the code on github.
*Simple, if you get the code: Get me to toggle you as a contributor to this repo,
via a github account you created, and directly improve the code pages on the web.
*Simple&do-it-yourself: Fork the code to make yourself a clean, separated version and
submit changes back for me to help put on the website, or slightly more involved,
pull the patches off your fork and submit code change suggestions back to the 
mud coders directly.
