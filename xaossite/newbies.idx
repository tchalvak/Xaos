<h2>Survival Tips</h2>
<p><img src="images/Survival_Essentials.png"></p>
<p>
One of the major things that you need to be aware of is that <b>almost every npcs is stronger than you when you first start out.</b>  As a result, attacking <b>anything</b> without careful consideration can easily get you killed, or worse, cast out of your clan.  In the beginning, your best bet is to ask other players where to go nearby to kill defenseless mobs, or just cast spells and try out skills to gain experience.  Find yourself a good temple (The temple to <a href="index.php?page=religions/xaos" target="_blank">Xaos</a> in Visari is the suggested religion for new players), find an altar to pray at, and learn to love your healers.  They'll <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">save your life</span> bring you quickly back to life after you've gotten yourself killed.<p/>

<h2> Skills to Learn First</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find a trainer-mob, they usually have "teacher" or "trainer" in their name.</li>
<li>Type "learn list" to see if the trainer has any of the skills that you need.</li>
<li>Type "learn &lt;skill name&gt;" to get a skill or spell.</li>

<div id='levelling-suggestions'>
<h2> Levelling Suggestions</h2>
<p>
First, ask players where appropriate mobs for you to kill for your level are.  Otherwise, in the beginning, you should just stick to killing "Dummies" (which give experience when you kill them, and don't do damage), or "Training Poles"/"Magic Bubbles" (which let you get experience from raising skills/spells by using the skills/spells on them).  There should be some dummies or a training pole around where you start out.
<p></p>
Then, as soon as possible, get in the levelling areas that exists in the central area of the Mud, around the human city of Visari, where you should be able to killing mobs in the following order of <b>areas:</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The statues in the Museum of Light (north of visari)</li>
	<li>Half orcs in the Half Orc Cave (southeast of visari) or Nymphs in the Waterfall (northeast of visari)</li>
	<li>Crackle Harpies in the Ruin of Static (up the cliffs in the valley of the giants that is directly north of visari)</li>
	<li>Sentries in the Stronhold of Twenty (west along the road that goes west from Visari)</li>
	<li>Bebiliths in the Half Orc Cave (southeast of visari)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then after that you should be able to join up with hero groups and gain the final levels with them, if you're careful enough not to get killed. See the maps page, especially the world map, to get a general idea of where you should look for these levelling locations:

Finally, if you have any problems, just ask for help or answers over the ooc channel.
